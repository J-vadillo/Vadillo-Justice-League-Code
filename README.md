# Vadillo-Justice-League-Code
Hello! Welcome to my MAP Folder, where the majority of the work done by Jana Vadillo under Charlotte christensen in between the summer 2023 and 
present day is stored.

(TEMPORARY PASSAGE DELETE WHEN ORGANIZATION IS GOOD)
as this is a collection of a few years worth of work, which began when I was still very not good at code and even worse at organizing larger projects, the below outlines what an "end goal" directory structure for this work will look like, both for my personal reference in getting it to that state, and to hopfully help any who need to detangle any of this code before this is done unpack what is there.

# top layer
Where you are right now! largely just holds this readme, key plots in the paper, and directories for all the other relevant sections of the work.

## runnable modules
- pynbody: contains the pynbody code (version 2.1.1) used in analysis
- sims: contains the simulations used and analyzed for this project
- Jana Pynbody Utils: Contains Ipython files which house functions used across multiple sets of analysis. Read the readme in this folder for more details on the contained functions.



## -c directories
this flag  denotes code used for late stage analysis and the generation of new plots. Code within these will be unique to the situation (with more general functions found in Jana Pynbody Utils), so will primarily focus on unique types of analysis or  plotting. Generated plots will also be stored in the top layher of each of these. Each respective folder will have a readme explaining the primary types of data being generated within.


## non paper plots 
contains code for old/non relevant plots of high analysis level which did not make the cut for the final paper. Within these work such as kaplen meir curve analysis, varience of polar outflows, and similar types of work can be found

##  misc code
Not quite as high quality but often more exploratory "short term" peices of code usefull in specific situations. Largely not deleted for completeness and reference if needed, should contain things such as debugging files, practice, and broad code to get "big picture" ideas of simulations without pushing for more rigorous analysis.


## Outdated directories
these contain old or not yet categorized work, should hopfully be empty by the end of the summer but please note that things in this region are less likely to be heavily documented and are currently being worked on
- backups : before github was implemented, served as a very bad redundancy measure in the case that things broke, currently holds older less relevant code, and old versions of current code, should hopfully be emptied and improved throught the summer
- code : holds all code created for the project used before a propper oirganizational system was implemented. will be documented, and spread out across more relevant directories across the sumer
- plots : holds all plots generated before they where grouped with the code that made them. Ideally by the end of the summer no designated plots directory will be needed and instead, plots will reside in the same directory as the code that made them (with potentially this folder having a series of links to the relevant ones to easily browse all work)


## miscalenous directories
- mitsuru 2023 map : quick link to mitsuru directory for cross reference


if anything in here is unclear or if you have any further doubts about my work or where things are please email me at jana.vadillo1@gmail.com with any doubts so I can hopfully clear up any issues
